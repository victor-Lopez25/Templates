### Templates for projects

This is intended as a compilation of templates I use

Right now it contains a template for an SDL3 project that includes
 - SDL_image
 - SDL_ttf
 - A thread pool made by yours truely (doesn't support adding work from multiple threads)

I will look into issues but in general, I won't take pull requests unless they are for minor changes.

Any file with a name starting with SDL or SDL_ is licenced with SDL's Zlib license. See: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL?tab=Zlib-1-ov-file
